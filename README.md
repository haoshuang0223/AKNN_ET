## Installation
The installation prerequisites can be found in the FAISS installation instructions, which can be found [here](./docs/INSTALL.md).
To run DARTH, it is required that LightGBM is installed and is put in  `/opt/OpenBLAS/`.
To compile FAISS with our project, use:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . # For the paper, we used: -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DFAISS_ENABLE_GPU=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DFAISS_ENABLE_PYTHON=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DFAISS_OPT_LEVEL=avx2 -DBLA_VENDOR=OpenBLAS -DBLAS_LIBRARIES=/opt/OpenBLAS/lib/libopenblas.so -DLAPACK_LIBRARIES=/opt/OpenBLAS/lib/libopenblas.so -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/OpenBLAS/include -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/OpenBLAS/lib
ninja -C build faiss -j # Compiles FAISS
ninja -C build -j hnsw_test # For the driver code of HNSW-based experiments
```

To use the python scripts and notebooks, install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To reproduce experiments, see scripts in the `experiments` directory. 

## Datasets
Our evaluation utilized the following datasets: 
* [SIFT and GIST](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/)
* [DEEP](https://research.yandex.com/blog/benchmarks-for-billion-scale-similarity-search)
* [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
